# Epoch Vault

Epoch Vault is a Bitcoin-native Layer 1 protocol that allows users to lock BTC and bind it to a message until a predefined future condition is met.

## Concept

Epoch Vault transforms Bitcoin’s core properties — time, finality, and immutability — into a social and cultural primitive.  
Users can create a “digital will” by:

- Locking BTC on Bitcoin Layer 1
- Attaching an immutable message
- Defining a strict unlock condition (specific block height, timestamp, or next halving)

The locked BTC cannot be accessed before the condition is satisfied. When the unlock condition is reached, the BTC returns to the owner and the message becomes publicly visible (or decrypted if it was encrypted).

## Features

- Native Bitcoin Layer 1 time-locks (no bridges, no EVM)
- Immutable messages bound to BTC
- Independent, non-custodial vaults
- Optional public archive of messages
- Optional legacy mode for predefined secondary recipients

## Use Cases

- Send a message to the future
- Commit to a long-term project
- Create a digital time capsule
- Build trust and reputation on-chain

## Philosophy

Epoch Vault is not a betting platform, not a yield product, and not a prediction market.  
It is a commitment device and social primitive, secured by Bitcoin’s consensus, allowing users to create time-anchored, immutable statements for themselves or the public.
